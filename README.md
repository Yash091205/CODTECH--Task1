**Duration** : December 2024 to February 2025<br>
**Task-1** : Calculator performing operations like Addition, Substraction, Multiplication and Division.<br>

 ## Overview of the Project

 ### Objective : 
 The objective of the project is to create a calculator performing operations like Addition, Substraction, Multiplication and Division using python.

 ### Features:
 <ul>
Addition of two numbers<br>
Subtraction of two numbers<br>
Multiplication of two numbers<br>
Division of two numbers (with error handling for division by zero)<br>
The program takes user inputs for the numbers and the operation to be performed.<br>
</ul>

### Code Explanation
<ol>
1. The calci class:<br>
	<ol>
The class is initialized with two numbers (fno and sno).<br>
It contains four methods:<br><ol>
add(): Adds the two numbers and prints the result.<br>
sub(): Subtracts the second number from the first and prints the result.<br>
multi(): Multiplies the two numbers and prints the result.<br>
div(): Divides the first number by the second. If the second number is zero, an error message is displayed, and the program prompts the user again.</ol></ol><br>
2. The inp() function:<br><ol>
This function prompts the user to enter two numbers and creates an instance of the calci class with those numbers.</ol><br>
3. The main() function:<br><ol>
This is the core function of the program. 
It displays a menu of operations and asks the user to choose one.<br>
Depending on the user's choice, it calls the appropriate method from the calci class and displays the result.<br>
If the user chooses to exit (option 5), the program terminates.</ol><br>
</ol>
